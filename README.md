# Geocoding
A small project on Geocoding i.e. mapping your location on Google Maps using Google APIs in Python

This Python file maps your location onto Google Maps when you enter your location as input. This is done via the gmplot library in Python. We retirve the location from Google APIs with a JSON file and extract the latitude and longitude from the file. Then we use the gmplot functions to plot the location on the Google Maps. Note that this version of Google Maps is only for development purposes.
